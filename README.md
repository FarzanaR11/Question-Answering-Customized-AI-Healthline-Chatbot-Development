# Question-Answering-Customized-AI-Healthline-Chatbot-Development
I developed a question-answering chatbot for Healthline -  https://www.healthline.com/ using BERT, fine-tuning the model on a custom dataset of questions and answers to provide accurate, contextually relevant responses. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving for future deployment.
Here is the video tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=986ns26Q2B0&t=44s


Client Website Link: https://www.healthline.com/
Client Requirement: Develop a fully custom chatbot capable of answering clients' questions
based on the information available on the website.
Task Instructions
Part 1: Data Collection and Dataset Creation
1. Website Analysis:
○ Visit the client’s website
○ Explore the website thoroughly to gather relevant information. This may include
product descriptions, services offered, company information, FAQs, etc.

2. Dataset Creation:
○ Based on the gathered information, create a structured dataset that can be used
to train a chatbot.
○ Ensure the dataset covers various sections of the website, including services,
products, contact information, and any other relevant content.
○ Ensure coverage of all sections of the website. Organize the dataset to make
sure it captures a broad set of potential client queries.

Part 2: Model Training
3. Model Selection:
○ Choose a machine learning or deep learning model suitable for answering
questions based on the data.
○ Ensure the model is suitable for generating or selecting accurate responses
based on the user’s questions.

4. Training:
○ Train the model using the dataset.
○ Implement techniques and ensure it can accurately answer a wide range of
questions related to the content on the website.
○ Test the model during training to assess its performance and make necessary
adjustments.
5. Evaluation:
○ After training, evaluate the model's accuracy by asking a variety of questions
related to the website content.
○ Ensure the chatbot provides correct and contextually relevant responses.
Part 3: Submission
6. Code Submission:

○ Submited the Python scripts and created dataset
○ Used github to submit the code.
○ Ensured that the code is well-documented and easy to follow.
○ Created a short video of question answering of the chatbot.
