# Question-Answering-Customized-AI-Healthline-Chatbot-Development
I developed a question-answering chatbot for Healthline -  https://www.healthline.com/ using BERT, fine-tuning the model on a custom dataset of questions and answers to provide accurate, contextually relevant responses. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving for future deployment.


Interview Task Overview - 
Client Website Link: https://www.healthline.com/
Client Requirement: Develop a fully custom chatbot capable of answering clients' questions
based on the information available on the website.
Task Instructions
